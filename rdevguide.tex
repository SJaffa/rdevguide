\chapter{Getting Started}\label{GetStart}}

These instructions cover how to install R in Windows. The tools required to build R and R packages in Windows are also discussed.

\hypertarget{general-instructions}{%
\section{General instructions}\label{general-instructions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you install the latest version or R-patched or R-devel, it will not over-write the previous installation(s) in your Windows machine.
\item
  R uses a `major.minor.patchlevel' version numbering scheme. Accordingly there are three main releases of R available to install:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The official release (\texttt{r-release}),
  \item
    The patched release (\texttt{r-patched}), and
  \item
    The development release (\texttt{r-devel}).
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The \texttt{r-devel} is the next minor or eventually major release development version of R. Mostly, bug fixes are introduced in \texttt{r-patched}, while \texttt{r-devel} is for introducing new features.

\hypertarget{installR}{%
\section{Installing R}\label{installR}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The binary builds of R for Windows can be downloaded and installed from \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/}{here}. Along with the link to the latest stable release, this page also contains links to the binary builds of r-patched and r-devel.
\item
  Click on the download links to download an executable installer.
\item
  Select the language while installing, read the GNU general public license information, and select the destination location to start the installation. You will be prompted to select components at this stage: \texttt{User\ installation}, \texttt{32-bit\ User\ installation}, \texttt{64-bit\ User\ installation}, or \texttt{Custom\ installation}. The default option may be chosen for the questions from this step onwards to complete the installation.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{what-tools-do-you-need-to-build-r-from-source-on-windows}{%
\subsection{What tools do you need to build R from source on Windows?}\label{what-tools-do-you-need-to-build-r-from-source-on-windows}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/r-windows/docs/blob/master/faq.md\#what-is-rtools}{RTools} is the toolchain bundle that you can use to build R base and R packages containing compiled code, on Windows.
\item
  You also need a distribution of LaTeX installed for building R and checking packages. The MiKTeX distribution of LaTeX that is used on CRAN can be downloaded from \url{https://miktex.org}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{how-to-setup-rtools}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{How to setup \texttt{RTools}?}{How to setup RTools?}}\label{how-to-setup-rtools}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The latest version of \texttt{RTools} can be downloaded from \url{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/} and run in the Windows-style installer. You will need to know if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows machine (right-click \texttt{This\ PC} in Windows Explorer and check the properties if you are unsure).
\item
  Don't forget to add \texttt{RTools} to the path as documented on the download page.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{how-to-build-r}{%
\subsection{How to build R?}\label{how-to-build-r}}

To build R for Windows using \texttt{RTools} follow the instructions in this \href{https://github.com/r-windows/r-base\#readme}{README} file. There are two options available to build R. One is the quick development build and the other option is the full installer build.

For development and testing, you need only the quick development build. The quick build avoids building the manuals, which are generally not needed for development and testing.

However, even for the quick build there are some \href{https://github.com/r-windows/r-base/blob/master/quick-build.sh}{default requirements}. For instance, MikTeX is to be installed in \texttt{C:/Program\ Files} and you have 64-bit R. If necessary, these defaults can be customised. The installation path of MikTex can be customised \href{https://github.com/r-windows/r-base/blob/50a229fc76c50a5fb42c0daa367466aaf2318171/quick-build.sh\#L13}{here} whereas the Windows bit can be customised \href{https://github.com/r-windows/r-base/blob/50a229fc76c50a5fb42c0daa367466aaf2318171/quick-build.sh\#L6}{here}.

If you are a maintainer of the Windows CRAN releases then, the full installer build is available for building the complete installer as it appears on CRAN. It will build both the 32-bit and 64-bit R, the pdf manuals, and the installer program. You will use this to create the binary builds and not when building R from the source yourself.

\hypertarget{how-to-download-the-r-sources-directly-or-from-the-svn-repository}{%
\section{How to download the R sources directly or from the svn repository?}\label{how-to-download-the-r-sources-directly-or-from-the-svn-repository}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To download the R sources on Windows, you can use \texttt{tar} from the RStudio terminal.
\item
  If you want to checkout the sources from svn, it is probably best to install an SVN client. Either TortoiseSVN (\url{https://tortoisesvn.net/}, command line tool, and Windows Explorer integration) or SlikSVN (\url{https://sliksvn.com/download/}, just the command line tool) is recommended. They have simple Windows installers and you can use svn straight-away from Windows cmd or RStudio terminal.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-bug-in-r}{%
\section{What is a bug in R?}\label{what-is-a-bug-in-r}}

You may find a bug in R if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The R session terminates unexpectedly, or there is a segmentation fault, it might be a bug in R, unless you have written your own call to compiled code or an internal function (via \texttt{.C} or \texttt{.Internal}). The error may look like this:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\#  *** caught segfault ***}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# address (nil), cause \textquotesingle{}memory not mapped\textquotesingle{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  If the code does not do what the documentation says it should, then either the code or the documentation is wrong. Report either of which needs to be fixed.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note}:
When you are in doubt that there is a bug: (which should be most of the time!)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure whether the bug appears in a clean session of R. Many times, there are variables/commands/functions stored in history which might cause issues. Hence, check if the issue happens in a clean session. To do so, launch R from the command line with the \texttt{-\/-vanilla} option.
\item
  At times the code that is written is very complicated, has numerous package and file dependencies, has many function calls, etc.. In such scenarios it is quite common that the code throws an error and you are not able to solve it. You may tend to think that there is a bug that needs to be reported. Before doing so, try to produce a minimum working example of the code for the section where the error occurred. Add only those package and files which are required by that section, and see if the error appears still. Using this approach shall solve most of the errors.
\item
  Install R-devel, which is the most recent version of R from \href{https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/}{svn} / \href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn}{git} or \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html}{daily Windows build}, and see if your bug still exists in R-devel (it may have been fixed very recently).
\item
  \href{https://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/template/NamlServlet.jtp?macro=search_page\&node=909078\&query=isna\&days=0}{Search on R-devel email list for messages with keywords related to your possible bug}. If you find some related messages then read them to see if they clarify whether or not it is a bug. If you do not find any related messages, then please post a new message to R-devel. Your message should include (1) a brief description of the bug including current and expected behavior, (2) a minimal reproducible example.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{what-condition-might-not-be-a-bug}{%
\section{What condition might not be a bug?}\label{what-condition-might-not-be-a-bug}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In case the code is doing something unexpected, it may not necessarily be a bug. Carefully review the documentation of the function being called, and check whether the behaviour being exhibited on calling this function is the same as it was designed to do.
\item
  Issues with \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html\#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f}{\emph{seemingly} identical numbers} not being equal (especially floating point numbers) are usually not bugs.
\item
  If R is running slower than expected, then also it may not be a bug. Ask someone else to review your code in such a case.
\item
  If some function is working, but it is not defined in the best generalised way, then consult someone to look over your code. This may perhaps not be a bug; instead, it might be an alternative way of writing the function.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{checking-if-a-bug-is-already-reported}{%
\section{Checking if a bug is already reported}\label{checking-if-a-bug-is-already-reported}}

The first step before filing a bug report is to see whether the problem has already been reported. Checking if the bug is reported will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Save time for you and the developers
\item
  Help you see if the bug is already fixed for the next release
\item
  Lead you to learn what needs to be done to fix it
\item
  Determine if any additional information is needed
\end{enumerate}

The sections that follow discuss where to check whether a bug is already reported.

\hypertarget{levels-of-contributing-to-bug-what-do-you-do-when-you-find-a-bug}{%
\section{Levels of contributing to bug / What do you do when you find a bug?}\label{levels-of-contributing-to-bug-what-do-you-do-when-you-find-a-bug}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{ReportBug}{Report} the bug (if it is not already reported).
\item
  \href{}{Test} the bug.
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{FixBug}{Fix} the bug: Fixing a bug might require relatively more time. You may start a conversation about it on \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/index.cgi}{BugZilla}. This would require engagement with R Core team.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{what-are-some-places-where-you-may-find-a-bug}{%
\section{What are some places where you may find a bug?}\label{what-are-some-places-where-you-may-find-a-bug}}

You may find a bug in:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In the \protect\hyperlink{RCorePkgBug}{R-Core supported packages, their documentations, and/ or in the R language implementation}.
\item
  In \protect\hyperlink{nonRCorePkgBug}{packages and/or their documentations which are not supported by the R-Core}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{ReportBug}{%
\section{How to report a bug?}\label{ReportBug}}

Once you confirm a bug exists, you need to submit a bug report so that it gets fixed.

\hypertarget{RCorePkgBug}{%
\subsection{Bug in the R-Core supported packages, their documentations, and/ or in the R language}\label{RCorePkgBug}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Packages that are supported by the R-Core are labelled with \texttt{Maintainer:\ R\ Core\ Team\ \textless{}R-core@r-project.org\textgreater{}}. One simple way to get the information from R is by running the \texttt{maintainer("package\_name")} command.
\item
  The bug report for R-Core supported packages, their documentations, and/ or a bug report for the R language itself can be submitted either to R-devel, \href{https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html\#which_list}{see posting guide}, or to \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/}{Bugzilla}. In the future, we hope to have an option to report an issue to the \href{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/issues}{GitHub Mirror of R svn server}.
\item
  If you want to submit the bug report using Bugzilla, please ensure that you have a Bugzilla account. To get a Bugzilla account, please send an e-mail to \texttt{bug-report-request@r-project.org} from the address that you want to use as your login. In this e-mail, briefly explain why you need an account. A volunteer shall then create a Bugzilla account and add you to R's Bugzilla members.
\item
  Please ensure whether the bug is already fixed (in the upcoming changes in R) or reported (search for it from those already reported on Bugzilla, either on \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/query.cgi}{search existing bug reports}, may use the \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/query.cgi?format=advanced}{advanced search} option here, or \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr\&bug_status=NEW\&bug_status=ASSIGNED\&bug_status=CONFIRMED\&bug_status=REOPENED\&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED\&bugidtype=include\&chfieldto=Now\&cmdtype=doit\&emailassigned_to1=1\&emailassigned_to2=1\&emailcc2=1\&emailreporter2=1\&emailtype1=substring\&emailtype2=substring\&field0-0-0=noop\&long_desc_type=substring\&order=bugs.delta_ts\%20desc\&query_format=advanced\&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr\&type0-0-0=noop}{show open bugs new-to-old}).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{nonRCorePkgBug}{%
\subsection{Bug in the non R-Core supported packages and/or their documentations}\label{nonRCorePkgBug}}

For packages that are not maintained by the R-Core, the bug reports can be submiited at, perhaps, an issues tracker url on GitHub/GitLab/R-Forge. To find if such an issues tracker is available, you can look at the package \texttt{DESCRIPTION} file first (e.g.~using \texttt{packageDescription("package\_name")}) to check if a url is provided in the \texttt{BugReports} field. If that is not available, then the package maintainer can be contacted (using \texttt{maintainer("package\_name")}). In R running the function \texttt{bug.report(package\ =\ "package\_name")} shall direct you to either the GitHub issue tracker of the package, or to the bug tracking web page, or towards composing an e-mail to the package maintainer. This function \texttt{bug.report} is disabled in RStudio, by default. However, if you use \texttt{utils::bug.report(package\ =\ "package\_name")} then it works on RStudio as well. Please ensure that the bug is not already reported or fixed before reporting it in any of the ways suggested above.

\hypertarget{good-practices-in-reporting-bugs-expectations-of-a-good-bug-report}{%
\section{Good practices in reporting bugs / Expectations of a good bug report}\label{good-practices-in-reporting-bugs-expectations-of-a-good-bug-report}}

If you follow the practices given below, you will come up with a good bug report which might make it easier for the maintainer(s) to fix the bug.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Include a minimal reproducible example of the bug in your report. The maintainer should be able to quickly reproduce the bug on using the minimal example that you provide. Here is a \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example}{community wiki post} on how to make a minimal reproducible example.
\item
  Mention the software architecture on which the bug occurred.
\item
  Use inbuilt data sets as far as possible.
\end{enumerate}

In addition to the above, here are the \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html}{bug writing guidelines} on Bugzilla. The \href{https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html\#writing-a-good-bug-report}{bug reporting} documentation in R also the discusses practices to write a good bug report.

Once you have successfully reported a bug, you will likely receive an update each time an action is taken on the bug. On Bugzilla, the report may be given one of the following status: New, Assigned, Confirmed, Reopened, Unconfirmed.

\hypertarget{disagreement-with-a-resolution-on-the-bug-tracker}{%
\section{Disagreement with a resolution on the bug tracker}\label{disagreement-with-a-resolution-on-the-bug-tracker}}

As humans, there might be differences of opinions from time to time. What needs to be considered here is that, being respectful of the fact that care, thought, and volunteer time has gone into the resolution of the issue or bug.

If you take some time, then on reflection, the resolution steps may seem more reasonable than you initially thought. If you still feel that the resolution is incorrect, then raise a thoughtful question to the person who resolved it. If the issue was carefully thought about in the first place then is less likely to win any conversion of thought.

As a reminder, issues closed by a core developer on Bugzilla have already been carefully considered. Please do not reopen a closed issue. Although one can comment on a closed issue, if necessary. Every comment on an issue generates an email to every R-core member (unless they have the notifications disabled). So it would be best to be considerate while commenting on issues, especially in case of the closed issues or when you are commenting in pure agreement without adding anything beyond that to a discussion (the +1 type posts which are perfectly acceptable in other contexts).

\section{How you can help to review bug reports?}\label{how-you-can-help-to-review-bug-reports}}

After understanding where bugs are reported in R (Bugzilla) or in other projects (GitHub/GitLab/R-Forge), a great way to contribute is reviewing bug reports.

Around the clock, new bug reports are being submitted on Bugzilla or the bug trackers (for instance, GitHub issues) of R packages and existing bug reports are being updated. Every bug report needs to be reviewed to make sure various things are in proper order. You can help with this process of reviewing bugs.

\hypertarget{preparing-to-review-bug-reports}{%
\subsection{Preparing to review bug reports}\label{preparing-to-review-bug-reports}}

If you want to review bug reports on Bugzilla, you are required to have a Bugzilla account. To get a Bugzilla account send an e-mail to \texttt{bug-report-request@r-project.org} from the address you want to use as your Bugzilla login. Briefly explain why you want a Bugzilla account and a volunteer will add you to R's Bugzilla members. More details on how you can review a bug report are available on this \href{https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/10/09/r-can-use-your-help-reviewing-bug-reports/}{blog}

\hypertarget{classifying-bug-reports}{%
\section{Classifying bug reports}\label{classifying-bug-reports}}

A good bug report is the one which:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Explains clearly how to reproduce the bug.
\item
  Includes the version of R, the machine architecture, and the operating system platform on which the bug occurred.
\end{enumerate}

Relevant details should be a part of a good bug report. You can help with the following tasks once you have some R programming experience:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Reproducing the bug: If you see a bug report which does not clearly explain how to reproduce it, you can try reproducing the bug and eventually make things easier for the core developer(s) and/or package maintainer(s).
\item
  Checking different binary builds: Check whether the bug occurs on a different binary build of R. It is helpful to know whether the bug is affecting: \texttt{r-patched}, \texttt{r-devel}, or \texttt{r-release} binary builds of R.
\item
  Writing a unit test: If the bug report lacks a unit test that should be a part of R's test suite, then you can help with providing it.
\end{enumerate}

These helpful tasks allow the Core developers and/ or maintainers to classify a bug report properly, so that the bug can be handled in a timely fashion.

\hypertarget{how-to-find-a-bug-report-or-an-issue-to-review}{%
\section{How to find a bug report or an issue to review?}\label{how-to-find-a-bug-report-or-an-issue-to-review}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  You may search old bug reports or issues that could be closed. Old bug reports may no longer be valid or may include a patch that is ready to be committed, but no one has had the time to review and commit.
\item
  You might also want to search for issues in topics in which you have a working knowledge. When on Bugzilla you can use the advanced search to find specific topics. Bug reports are by default public on Bugzilla (unless the defaults are changed to avoid security vulnerability).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{example-of-a-bug-review-submitted-on-bugzilla}{%
\section{Example of a bug review submitted on Bugzilla}\label{example-of-a-bug-review-submitted-on-bugzilla}}

If you would like to see how bugs are reviewed on Bugzilla, \href{https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16542}{here} is an example where an old bug report is being reviewed. It is tested to see if it was still an issue and a few ways are proposed to resolve the issue.

\textbf{Note}:

There is a \texttt{\#bug-reporting} channel on the \href{https://r-contributors.slack.com/}{R Contributors slack} where you can share your bug report(s) for review/feedback before submitting to Bugzilla. This can help with checking that it really is a bug, that you have included the important information and excluded redundant information.

\hypertarget{finding-the-source}{%
\chapter{Finding the Source}\label{finding-the-source}}

This chapter discusses how you can have an overview of the R codebase. For instance, where to find the implementation of a base function written in R and where to find a primitive implementation written in C. You may want to find the source code of a function just out of curiosity or maybe to gain more insight into what a particular function is actually doing. Whatever be the case, reading the source code will help you to learn a lot about any function.

\hypertarget{finding-r-source-code}{%
\section{Finding R source code}\label{finding-r-source-code}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Find the R function with the code of interest. You will always be able to print the top-level function (or use \texttt{View(function\_name)} in RStudio). Looking at the code for the body of this function will reveal what you need to do next:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Can already see code of interest: stop here or skip to step 3 to find the corresponding file in the R sources.
\item
  Code of interest is in nested R function: go to step 2.
\item
  Top-level function is an S3 generic, identified by a call to \texttt{UseMethod()}. Use \texttt{methods(function\_name)} to see available methods, then go to step 2.
\item
  Code of interest is in compiled code, identified by a call to \texttt{.C()}, \texttt{.Call()}, \texttt{.Fortran()}, and \texttt{.External()}, or \texttt{.Internal()} and \texttt{.Primitive()}: go to section on compiled code.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Nested functions or S3 methods may not be exported by the package they are in. If this is the case, the simplest way to view the code is to use \texttt{getAnywhere()} or \texttt{getS3method()}. Now you can keep looking at nested R functions till you find the code of interest or hit a call to compiled code.
\item
  Find an R function in the R sources. Two options here:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Search on the internet: For R Core packages, search on the GitHub mirror (\url{https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn}); for recommended packages, use the CRAN mirror (\url{https://github.com/cran}) - this will link to the source on GitHub if available, e.g.~\url{https://github.com/cran/survival}. Note that GitHub search ignores wildcard characters
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 . , : ; / \ ` ' " = * ! ? # $ & + ^ | ~ < > ( ) { } [ ]
\end{verbatim}

but this does not include \texttt{-} so you can search for a function or S3 method as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
"body <- function" extension:R
"quantile.ecdf <- function" extension:R
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Search in the R sources using grep: The \protect\hyperlink{GetStart}{Getting Started} chapter discusses how to download the R sources directly or from the svn repository. Now if the sources are in \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/R-devel}, you can search as follows:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
grep -R "body <- function" ~/R-devel/src
grep -R "quantile <- function" ~/R-devel/src/library
\end{verbatim}

Note: The above procedure does not cover S4, R6 or RC generics or methods. Refer \href{https://github.com/jennybc/access-r-source}{accessing R source} for further details.

\hypertarget{finding-c-source-code}{%
\section{Finding C source code}\label{finding-c-source-code}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If \texttt{.Internal()} or \texttt{.Primitive()}, find entry point in \texttt{names.c} as described in the Jenny Bryan's post of \href{https://github.com/jennybc/access-r-source}{accessing R source}. For all other calls to compiled code, you can find the entry point from within R. For instance, the body of complete.cases() is
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
.External(C_compcases, ...)
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{C\_compcases} inherits from class ``NativeSymbolInfo'' and we can extract the name of the entry point via

\begin{verbatim}
stats:::C_compcases$name
\end{verbatim}

We know that it is in the stats package as we see that when we print complete.cases or look at the help file. This shows us that the entry point is simply ``compcases'' and in fact that is the general convention in R code, that you simply remove the \texttt{C\_} prefix (sometimes \texttt{.F\_} for Fortran code) in the name of the object passed to the first argument of the call.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Once you have the entry point, search as for R code. In the case of searching on GitHub, restrict the search to files with the relevant extension
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
compcases extension:c
lowesw extension:f
\end{verbatim}

similarly for grep

\begin{verbatim}
grep -R --include=*.c "compcases" ~/R-devel/src/library/
\end{verbatim}

Note:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Many editors (like RStudio, ESS) support \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags}{ctags} for code browsing, making it easy to jump to definitions of functions. \texttt{R\ CMD\ rtags} can generate ctags for any R code (Credit: Deepayan Sarkar).
\item
  A more sophisticated system is called GNU GLOBAL, which also supports
  finding all references (calls) to a function.
\item
  GitHub has a code navigation feature via the library tree-sitter. Unfortunately, it does not have R support yet. An \href{https://github.com/r-lib/tree-sitter-r}{R driver for tree-sitter} made by Jim Hester is available.

\hypertarget{FixBug}{%
\chapter{Lifecycle of a Patch}\label{FixBug}}

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

R uses a workflow based on patches. A patch is the set of differences (additions and deletions) between two versions of code. So you can create a patch defining a bug fix or a proposed update to the R codebase and submit it through your official Bugzilla account to the core developer(s). Be clear in your communication as it is the key to contributing to any project, especially an open source project like R.

\hypertarget{when-do-you-submit-a-patch}{%
\section{When do you submit a patch?}\label{when-do-you-submit-a-patch}}

There might be a situation where you come across a bug in R, which you may have an idea of how to fix. This can turn out to be an opportunity for you to submit a patch. By submitting a patch or a bug fix, you are helping to reduce the workload on the R developers in addition to yourself being a contributor to R!

When you submit a patch, you are helping the developer(s) and maintainer(s) so that they do not have to write the entire code from scratch. Instead, they can test and tweak your patch, if necessary.

\hypertarget{what-tools-are-required-to-submit-a-patch}{%
\section{What tools are required to submit a patch?}\label{what-tools-are-required-to-submit-a-patch}}

To submit a patch, you need:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{http://subversion.apache.org/}{SVN} installed on your machine.
\item
  The \protect\hyperlink{installR}{latest developer version of R}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{how-to-prepare-a-patch}{%
\section{How to prepare a patch?}\label{how-to-prepare-a-patch}}

Refer to the guidelines given \href{https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html\#how-to-submit-patches}{here} for the process to prepare a patch against R-devel.

\hypertarget{GoodPatches}{%
\section{Making good patches}\label{GoodPatches}}

When creating a patch for submission, there are several things that you can do to help ensure that your patch is accepted:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Make sure to follow \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html\#R-coding-standards}{R's coding standards} (R is a GNU project and there are GNU coding standards). The coding style of the patch you submit should largely match with the codebase it is being applied to. If your patch has one or two minor discrepancies, then those may be fixed by the core developer who will eventually test your patch. However, if there are systematic deviations from the style guides your patch will be put on hold until you fix the formatting issues. There is no comprehensive official R style manual, however some nearly universal standards are summarised in \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rockchalk/vignettes/Rstyle.pdf}{this article}.
\item
  Be aware of backwards-compatibility considerations. While the core developer who eventually handles your patch will make the final call on whether something is acceptable, thinking about backwards-compatibility early will help prevent having your patch rejected on these grounds. Put yourself in the shoes of someone whose code will be broken by the change(s) introduced by the patch. It is quite likely that any change made will break someone's code, so you need to have a good reason to make a change as you will be forcing someone to update their code. This obviously does not apply to new functions or new arguments. New arguments should be optional and have default values which maintain the existing behaviour. If in doubt, \protect\hyperlink{WhereToGetHelp}{discuss} the issue with experienced developers.
\item
  Make sure you have proper tests to verify that your patch works as expected. Patches may not be accepted without the proper tests.
\item
  Make sure the entire test suite runs without failure because of your changes. It is not sufficient to only run whichever test seems impacted by your changes, because there might be interactions unknown to you between your changes and some other part of the interpreter.
\item
  Proper documentation additions/changes should be included.
\item
  Each bugfix should ideally be addressed by a single patch. In particular, do not fix more than one issue in the same patch (except, if one code change fixes all of them) and do not do cosmetic changes to unrelated code in the same patch as some bugfix.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{submitting-your-patch-for-review}{%
\section{Submitting your patch for review}\label{submitting-your-patch-for-review}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Patch in response to a pre-existing issue or bug report: In this case, you should attach the patch to the existing issue or bug report on Bugzilla with a brief comment.
\item
  Patch in response to an unreported issue or bug report: Assuming you already performed a search on Bugzilla for a pre-existing issue or bug and did not find the issue or bug reported, you need to create a new bug report and include your patch with it. Please fill in as much relevant detail as possible to prevent reviewers from having to delay reviewing your patch because of lack of information. Include (mostly as the first sentence), a to-the-point explanation of what the purpose of the patch is. This sentence should not be in the descriptive form, rather an imperative form will be more suitable here. If this is not enough detail for a patch, a new paragraphs(s) can be added to explain in proper depth what has happened. The details should be good enough that a core developer reading it understands the justification for the change.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{getting-your-patch-reviewed}{%
\section{Getting your patch reviewed}\label{getting-your-patch-reviewed}}

To begin with, please be patient. There are many more people submitting patches than there are people capable of reviewing your patches. Getting your patch reviewed requires a reviewer to have the spare time and motivation to look at your patch. We cannot force anyone to review patches and no one is employed to look at patches.

There is a \texttt{\#patches-for-review} channel on the \href{https://r-contributors.slack.com/}{R Contributors slack} where you can share your patch(es) for review/feedback before submitting to R-Core/Bugzilla. This can help with checking that you have included the important information and excluded redundant information.

If your patch has not received any notice from reviewers (i.e., no comment made) after one month, comment/message on the \texttt{\#patches-for-review} channel to remind the members that the patch needs a review.

When someone does manage to find the time to look at your patch they will most likely make comments about how it can be improved. It is then expected that you update your patch to address these comments, and the review process will thus iterate until a satisfactory solution has emerged.

\hypertarget{how-to-review-a-patch}{%
\subsection{How to review a patch?}\label{how-to-review-a-patch}}

One of the bottlenecks in the R development process is the lack of code reviews. If you browse Bugzilla, you will see that numerous issues have a fix, but cannot be merged into the main source code repository, because no one has reviewed the proposed solution. Reviewing a patch can be just as informative as providing a patch and it will allow you to give constructive comments on another developer's work. This guide provides a checklist for submitting a patch review. It is a common misconception that in order to be useful, a patch review has to be perfect. This is not the case at all. It is helpful to just test the patch and/or play around with the code and leave comments in the patch or on Bugzilla.

If a bug report or an issue has a patch attached that has not been reviewed, you can help by making sure that the patch:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  follows the style guides;
\item
  is a good solution to the problem it is trying to solve;
\item
  includes proper tests; and
\item
  includes proper documentation changes.
\end{itemize}

Also refer to \protect\hyperlink{GoodPatches}{Making good patches} for more ideas. Doing all of this allows the core developer(s) and/ or maintainer(s) to more quickly look for subtle issues that only people with extensive experience working on R's codebase will notice.

\hypertarget{leaving-a-patch-review-on-bugzilla}{%
\section{Leaving a patch review on Bugzilla}\label{leaving-a-patch-review-on-bugzilla}}

When you review a patch, you should provide additional details and context of your review process and leave comments. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you tested the patch, report the result and the system and version tested on, such as `Windows 10', `Ubuntu 16.4', or `Mac High Sierra'.
\item
  If you request changes, try to suggest how or attach an updated patch.
\item
  Comment on what is `good' about the patch, not just the `bad'. Doing so will make it easier for the patch author to find the good in your comments.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{dismissing-review-from-another-core-developer}{%
\section{Dismissing review from another core developer}\label{dismissing-review-from-another-core-developer}}

A core developer can dismiss another core developer's review if they confirmed that the requested changes have been made. When a core developer has assigned the patch to themselves, then it is a sign that they are actively looking after the patch, and their review should not be dismissed.

\hypertarget{acceptance-or-rejection-of-your-patch}{%
\section{Acceptance or rejection of your patch}\label{acceptance-or-rejection-of-your-patch}}

Once your patch has reached an acceptable state, it will either be applied or rejected. If it is rejected, please do not take it personally. Your work is still appreciated regardless of whether your patch is applied. Balancing what does and does not go into R is tricky and everyone's contributions cannot always be accepted.

But if your patch is accepted and applied it will then go on to be released with the next patched release and eventually the next major release of R. It may also be backported to older versions of R as a bugfix if the core developer doing the patch acceptance believes it is warranted.

It may take longer before your patch is accepted and applied or rejected, sometimes even months or years. Nonetheless, it is appreciated that you submitted a patch.

\hypertarget{documenting-r}{%
\chapter{Documenting R}\label{documenting-r}}

The R language has a substantial body of documentation, much of which is contributed by various authors. The help files for R functions are written in `R documentation' (.Rd) file format. It is a simple markup language with close resemblance to LaTeX. The .Rd file format can be further processed into a variety of formats, including LaTeX, HTML, and plain text.

This chapter describes the styleguide for R's documentation, how to document for R, report and review bugs (and suggest corrections for them) in the existing documentation. If you are interested in contributing to R's documentation, your contributions are more than welcome.

\hypertarget{introduction-2}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

R's documentation has long been considered to be good for a free programming language. The core developers have been committed to providing good documentation on the language and its packages. The continuing involvement of the user community in providing assistance for creating and maintaining documentation has also supported a lot.

The involvement of the community takes many forms, from authoring to bug reports to raising an issue when the documentation could be more complete or easier to use.

This chapter is aimed at authors and potential authors of documentation for R. More specifically, it is for people contributing to the standard documentation and developing additional documents using the same tools as the standard documents. Any time you feel that you can clarify existing documentation or provide documentation that is missing, your contribution will be welcome and highly appreciated. If you find it difficult to deal with the markup language, you can ask for help for that part too. Please do not let the material in this chapter stand between the documentation and your desire to help out.

\hypertarget{guidelines-for-writing-the-system-help-files-in-.rd-format}{%
\section{Guidelines for writing the system help files (in .Rd format)}\label{guidelines-for-writing-the-system-help-files-in-.rd-format}}

Following are the suggested guidelines while creating the system help files in the .Rd format. These are intended for writing the core documentations but may also be useful for package writers. (share documentation of a simple base function here?)

There are three main parts of an .Rd file:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Header}: This part is for the basic information of the document/file. For instance, the name of the file, the topics documented, a title, a short textual description, and R usage information for the objects documented.
\item
  \textbf{Body}: This part includes further information on the function's arguments and return value.
\item
  \textbf{Footer}: This part is optional. Usually the keyword information is included here.
\end{enumerate}

All the above information is included in a .Rd file within a series of sections with standard names (user-defined sections are also allowed). These sections are discussed below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}title} section:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Capitalize each word.
  \item
    Do not end in a period.
  \item
    Avoid use of markup language (because markup language need not be suitable for various hypertext search systems).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}usage} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}examples} sections:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Line length of 65 characters is advised.
  \item
    Use \texttt{TRUE} instead of \texttt{T} and \texttt{FALSE} instead of \texttt{F}.
  \item
    Add spaces around binary operators.
  \item
    Add spaces after commas in the argument lists.
  \item
    Use \texttt{\textless{}-} rather than \texttt{=} for assignments.
  \item
    Add spaces around the \texttt{\textless{}-} operator.
  \item
    Do not use tabs to indent (as these do not render correctly on all possible pagers).
  \item
    Use 4 spaces to indent the (example) code.
  \item
    Make sure the examples are directly executable.
  \item
    The examples should be system-independent.
  \item
    The examples should not require special facilities (for instance, Internet access or write permission to specific directories).
  \item
    Examples should also not take longer than necessary to run, as they are run when checking a build of R.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}synopsis} section: The \texttt{\textbackslash{}usage} section can have the function definition, or the actual definition can be included in the \texttt{\textbackslash{}synopsis} section.
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}source} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}references} sections:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Author(s) names should be written in the form \texttt{Author,\ A.\ B.}.
  \item
    Author(s) names should be separated by a comma or \texttt{and} (but not both).
  \item
    Separate paragraphs (separated by a blank line) should be used for each reference.
  \item
    Give a date immediately after the author(s) names.
  \item
    Do not put a period after the date.
  \item
    Titles of books and journals (not articles) should be enclosed in \texttt{\textbackslash{}emph\{...\}}.
  \item
    Volume numbers for journals are to be enclosed in \texttt{\textbackslash{}bold\{...\}} and followed by a comma.
  \item
    Use \texttt{-\/-} for page ranges.
  \item
    For giving an address for a publisher use the format \texttt{New\ York:\ Springer-Verlag}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

More guidelines for writing .Rd files can be found \href{https://developer.r-project.org/Rds.html}{here}.

The language used in the documentations should follow these basic rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Affirmative tone should be used to describe what the function does and how to use it effectively. Rather than creating worry in the mind of a reader, it should establish confident knowledge about the effective use of the particular function/feature.
\item
  More documentation is not necessarily better documentation. Long descriptions full of corner cases and caveats can create the impression that a function is more complex or harder to use than it actually is. Be succinct but exhaustive.
\item
  Short code examples can help in understanding better. Readers can often grasp a simple example more quickly than they can digest a formal description. Usually people learn faster with concrete, motivating examples that match the context of a typical use case.
\item
  Giving a code equivalent (or approximate equivalent) can be a useful addition to the description provided. You should carefully weigh whether the code equivalent adds value to the document.
\item
  The tone of the documentation needs to be respectful of the reader's background. Lay out the relevant information, show motivating use cases, provide glossary links, and do your best to connect-the-dots. The documentation is meant for newcomers, many of whom will be using it to evaluate the R language as a whole. The experience needs to be positive and not leave the reader with worries that something bad will happen if they make a mistake.

\hypertarget{helping-with-documentation}{%
\section{Helping with documentation}\label{helping-with-documentation}}

Maintaining the accuracy of R's documentations and keeping a high level of quality takes a lot of effort. Community members, like you, help with writing, editing, and updating content, and these contributions are appreciated and welcomed.

Looking at pre-existing documentation source files can be very helpful when getting started.

If you look at documentation issues on Bugzilla, you will find various documentation problems that may need work. Issues vary from typos to unclear documentation and items lacking documentation.

If you see a documentation issue that you would like to tackle, you can leave a comment on the issue saying you are going to try to solve the issue and mention roughly how long you think you will take to do so (this allows others to take on the issue if you happen to forget or lose interest).

\hypertarget{proofreading}{%
\section{Proofreading}\label{proofreading}}

While an issue filed on Bugzilla means there is a known issue somewhere, that does not mean there are not other issues lurking about in the documentation. Proofreading a part of the documentation can often uncover problems.

If you decide to proofread, read a section of the documentation from start to finish, filing issues in Bugzilla for each major type of problem you find. It is best to avoid filing a single issue for an entire section containing multiple problems; instead, file several issues so that it is easier to break the work up for multiple people and more efficient review.

\hypertarget{helping-with-the-developers-guide}{%
\section{Helping with the Developer's Guide}\label{helping-with-the-developers-guide}}

The Developer's Guide (what you are reading now) uses the same process as the main R documentation, except for some small differences. The source lives in a \href{https://github.com/forwards/rdevguide}{GitHub repository} and bug reports should be submitted to the \href{https://github.com/forwards/rdevguide/issues}{devguide GitHub tracker}.

Our dev guide workflow uses continuous integration and deployment so changes to the dev guide are normally published when the pull request is merged. \protect\hyperlink{how-to-contribute-to-this-guide}{How to contribute to this guide from the introduction.}

\hypertarget{testing-pre-release-r-versions}{%
\chapter{Testing Pre-release R Versions}\label{testing-pre-release-r-versions}}

This chapter is inspired from the blog on \href{https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/04/28/r-can-use-your-help-testing-r-before-release/index.html}{testing R before release} and discusses how you can help with testing of pre-release versions of R.

\hypertarget{where-to-test}{%
\section{Where to test?}\label{where-to-test}}

Whenever possible use a fresh package library for testing, even better would be to use \protect\hyperlink{VM}{virtual machines} for the testing. This would ensure that you do not damage your existing R installation.

\hypertarget{VM}{%
\subsection{Virtual machine}\label{VM}}

A free Windows 10 virtual machine is provided by Microsoft (with a 90-day limit) for building, testing, and checking R packages and R itself. Package maintainers who work on Linux and MacOS can use it to test their packages on Windows. Read the \href{https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/vm.html}{instructions} on how to automatically set up the machine to check R packages. Tomas Kalibera describes the details of using virtual machine in the blog \href{https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/03/18/virtual-windows-machine-for-checking-r-packages/index.html}{Virtual Windows machine for checking R packages}.

\hypertarget{what-can-you-test}{%
\section{What can you test?}\label{what-can-you-test}}

You can test:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Your own programs.
\item
  Your own workflows.
\item
  Your special ways of installing or setting up R.
\item
  Things that interact with external libraries.
\item
  Interactive R packages.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{writing-tests-for-r}{%
\section{Writing tests for R}\label{writing-tests-for-r}}

Writing tests for R is much like writing tests for your own code. Tests need to be thorough, fast, isolated, consistently repeatable, and as simple as possible.

When you are adding tests to an existing test file, it is also recommended that you study the other tests in that file; it will teach you which precautions you have to take to make your tests robust and portable. We try to have tests both for normal behaviour and for error conditions. Tests live in the \texttt{tests} directory.

\hypertarget{benchmarks}{%

Benchmarking is useful to test that a change does not degrade performance.

\hypertarget{subversion-svn-client}{%
\section{Subversion (svn) client}\label{subversion-svn-client}}

Subversion (svn) is a version control system that tracks any changes made to files and directories. You can install either the TortoiseSVN (\url{https://tortoisesvn.net/}, command line tool, and Windows Explorer integration) or the SlikSVN (\url{https://sliksvn.com/download/}, just the command line tool) client. They have Windows installers and can be used from Windows cmd or RStudio terminal.
