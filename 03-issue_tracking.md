Base R uses [Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/) for issue tracking and reporting bugs. 

## How to contribute to issue tracking

Contributors can support issue tracking in R by

1. [Reporting bugs](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/ReportBugs.html) or making feature requests (bug reports filed under the "Wishlist" component in Bugzilla),

2. [Reviewing bug reports](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/ReviewBugs.html) to help close reports where no fix is needed or to help narrow down the problem and identify what needs to be fixed, or

3. [Proposing changes](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/FixBug.html#FixBug) to code or documentation that will close an issue. 

## How to get a Bugzilla account  {#bugzilla-account}

Anyone can browse the bug reports on Bugzilla, but you will need an account to file a bug report, to comment on an existing bug report, or to submit a proposed fix in the form of patch file. 

To get a Bugzilla account send an e-mail to `bug-report-request@r-project.org` from the address you want to use as your Bugzilla login. Briefly explain why you want a Bugzilla account and a volunteer will add you to R's Bugzilla members. After having successfully logged in to Bugzilla, you are good to go.
